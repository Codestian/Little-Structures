# Privacy Policy

Preface
The main focus of LittleStructures is to provide a sharing-platform for ‘LittleTiles’ related data. In this document we hope to provide a transparent overview of what personal data we need to achieve this.
In short
We take effort in making sure we handle all personal data regarding the laws and regulation including the GDPR. This means that we:
• Use personal data for what they were intended for as described in this document;
• Restrict personal data collection to what is absolutely necessary for us to carry out our services;
• Strictly ask permission before we use personal data as/if required by the GDPR; (following GDPR article 6 paragraph 1)
• Take precautionary measures to make sure all personal data we use are secure;
• Make sure only personal who meet the requirements of the GDPR will process personal data; (following GDPR chapter IV, particularly article 28)
• DO NOT pass any personal data to third-parties unless they are required to carry out our services;
• Are aware of the rights regarding personal data and will respect those in carrying out our services.
If any questions arises regarding this document, please contact us for any questions. Our contact details can be found at the bottom of this document.

Used terms
For the sake of clarity this Privacy policy will describe two distinct types of data separately:
• General data;
• Member/account data.
The general data applies to everyone visiting the website, including those who are using an account. The member/account data applies to everyone using an account.

General data

Wat do we do with your data?
We collect this type of data to ensure we can:
• Improve stability and functionality of the website;
• Monitor for suspicious/illegal activity and ensure data security.
On what base and what data do we collect/use?
The collection this type of data is based on ‘legitimate interest’ conform the GDPR article 6 paragraph 1 point f. The data we collect are: (data in bold font is considered special-personal data)
• Ip-address;
• Time of access;
• User agent (which includes browser and system type/version);
• Accessed URL;
• Connected account;
• Login requests.
How is your data stored and for how long?
The above data are be stored in the web-application logging and the security data/audit data. Neither of these are publicly accessible and are secured using high industry standards. Where possible data is pseudonymized. The web-application logging data is retained for at most 14 days while the security data/audit data is retained for at most 30 days.
TODO this would greatly improve with an example
Is your data shared with third-parties?
Unless mentioned in this document, all the above mentioned data are never shared with third-parties unless lawfully required and confirm the GDPR (as can be found in chapter V regarding 'Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations’).

Member/account data

What do we do with your data?
We collect this type of data so we can:
• Provide a means of identification for online actions such as uploading data (e.g. LittleTiles structures) and public communication;
• Improve and personalize web-application functionality;
• Communicate with you.
On what base and what data do we collect/use?
The collection this type of data is based on ‘permission/consensus’ conform the GDPR article 6 paragraph 1 point a. The data we collect are: (data in bold font is considered special-personal data)
• E-mail address (corresponding the Mojang’s Minecraft account email address);
• Mojang’s Minecraft account universal unique identifier(UUID);
• Minecraft in-game name;
• Minecraft in-game skin texture;
• Last-login date-time;
• Join date-time;
• Web-application preferences;
• Uploaded data such as ‘LittleTiles structures’.
Data we use but do not store:
• The Mojang’s Minecraft account password
How is your data stored and for how long?
All of the above mentioned collected data are secured using high industry standards. The e-mail address and the password corresponding the Mojang’s Minecraft account is used for authentication using the Mojang authentication API (https://wiki.vg/Authentication). From this API we retrieve the Minecraft account UUID and the Minecraft in-game name. The Mojang’s Minecraft account e-mail address will be used as means of communication. The Mojang’s Minecraft account password will NEVER be stored by us!
The Minecraft in-game skin texture is retrieved from ‘crafatar’ (https://crafatar.com/) using the Mojang’s Minecraft account UUID.
An account is retained for at least 3 months after the last-login date-time, or 2 years after the last-login date-time if an ‘special action’ is performed with that account (e.g. uploading a ‘LittleTiles structure’). Upon deleting an account the e-mail address, last-login date-time, join date-time and web-application preferences are deleted as well. The Mojang’s Minecraft account UUID, Minecraft in-game name and Minecraft in-game skin is retained as identifier for any public performed actions (i.e. publicly visible uploaded data).

Upon re-registering/login after an account deletion any public performed actions linked with the Mojang’s Minecraft account UUID will be relinked to the newly created account.
Upon initiation of the account owner all data mentioned above can be deleted (including public performed actions and the account itself).

What of my data can I control?
Some of the above mentioned data can be altered/removed (direct or indirect) by the owner of the data.
The Mojang’s Minecraft account UUID is not modifiable, and will remain as identifier for any public performed actions (i.e. publicly visible uploaded data) even when the linked account is deleted.
The Mojang’s Minecraft account e-mail address, password, in-game name and in-game texture are not modifiable through our systems. Go to the official Mojang website (https://www.mojang.com/) if you want to change any of them. After logging into our systems the old e-mail address will automatically be replaced by the new e-mail address. The in-game name and texture will automatically be replaced.
The last-login date-time and join date-time is not directly modifiable, but is changed based on when you joined/last logged in. Both will be deleted if the account is deleted.
The web-application preference can be altered via the account-preference view, and will be deleted if the account is deleted.
All publicly performed actions (including uploading data) is modifiable/removable via the account. Any publicly performed actions will be retained if an account expires due to inactivity (2 years after last-login date-time). The data is linked to the Mojang’s Minecraft account UUID (of which the Minecraft in-game name and texture will be retrieved for public display). Upon re-registering/login after an account deletion any public performed actions linked with the Mojang’s Minecraft account UUID will be relinked to the newly created account, and can at that point be controlled again.
Is your data shared with third-parties?
Unless mentioned in this document, all the above mentioned data are never shared with third-parties unless lawfully required and confirm the GDPR (as can be found in chapter V regarding 'Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations’).

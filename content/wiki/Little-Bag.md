# About

The Little Bag, previously known as the Little Container, is used to store the excess tiles that accumulate when working with the mod. As you cut a block or structure with the Little Hammer or other means, the tiles will be put inside the bag to keep them out of the player's inventory. Full blocks can also be placed into the bag manually so the Little Chisel can use them as well.

# 3. Chisel Modes

Right clicking with the chisel sets the first corner and draws a transparent preview that shows the shape and size of your structure. Right click again sets the second corner and places the shape. The chisel offers a variety of shapes:

## 3.1. Box 

The default setting that draws a six faced polygon

## 3.2. Sphere 

Draws an ellipse between two points

## 3.3. Cylinder 

Draws a cylinder between two points with the added option of choosing between facing Up/Down, 
                   North/South, and East/West. The flat surfaces of the cylinder will face the choosen orientation.

## 3.4. Wall 

Draws a wall between two points that can face U/D/N/S/E/W

![chisel - wall](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39905758-62af5d92-54b5-11e8-89d9-020b9aa9f854.gif)

## 3.5. Line 

Draws a single tile thick line between any two points. Unlike the wall tool, the line tool is not 
               constrained to connecting blocks on the same X, Z, or Z level. 

![chisel - line](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39905761-630c772a-54b5-11e8-87f8-716eda6ed05f.gif)

## 3.6. Slice

Draws a sloped tile between two points.

Depending on the size of the selection, the slice could be in different angles:

You can change the orientation of the slice by using the arrow keys:

At this point in time there are no corner slices and no immediate plans to add them either.

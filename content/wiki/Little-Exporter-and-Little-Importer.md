## About

The Little Exporter and Little Importer structures allow for the use of the [Export and Import Commands](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Useful-Features#exportimport) without the use of commands. In short, it allows you to export your creations to share with other players and import other players creations into your world.

## How to use

The use of these structures is identical to that of the [Export and Import Commands](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Useful-Features#exportimport). Please refer to that page for information on usability

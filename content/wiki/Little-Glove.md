### 3.2. Replace Mode

* In Replace mode, right clicking will replace the tile you're aiming at with the tile selected in the glove. 

So, for instance, if you made a wooden chair but now wants a iron one, you simply need to select iron in the glove using middle click, then right click the chair in replace mode. 

Let's follow this example: we made a very simple wooden table with a white wool layer on top.

Now we want to replace the White Wool with Orange Wool. In order to do that we first need to middle click in a Orange Wool block in order to select it in the glove, or choose it from the drop down menu in Pixel Mode.

Now right click on the material you want to replace (White Wool) and voil√†, it's replaced.

**Note that right clicking will only replace a tile segment, if you wish to replace all specific material in a block space you need to shift right click.**

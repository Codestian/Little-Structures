# 1. Using it
The _Little Recipe_ is used to combine every tile in a selected rectangular area into a single structure, stored in a single item. After the structure is saved in the recipe, it can be given a variety of functionalities.

To use a _Little Recipe_, right click on a corner of the structure you wish to save, then right click into a second spot in an opposite corner. Every tile between the two spots (in a rectangular area) will be selected. **Note that normal Minecraft blocks will not be saved into the recipe**.

# 2. The GUI

After the structure is in the recipe, right clicking will open the GUI:

![default gui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39399648-ff83d52a-4af7-11e8-91af-5ee2d511e10c.png)

**(1)** Type of Structure

**(2)** Save settings

The default structure type is set to None. This type of GUI is also shared with the Fixed, Chair and Ladder structure types.

Note that clicking ESC or your Inventory button will exit the screen WHITOUT SAVING your setting. Always click SAVE after setting up the structure.

# 3. Types of Structures:

## 3.1 **None** 

The default setting. When placed, works the same way as it did before being turned into a recipe. Useful for piecing structures bigger than one block together for easy transport or placement.

![none](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400743-c2243926-4b0c-11e8-87ec-d73017e85cbe.gif)


## 3.2 **Fixed** 

Makes so the entire structure works like a single, unmodifiable prop. Left clicking this structure will breaking it as a whole. In order to modify it, you'll need to create a new recipe.

![fixed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400764-2e654ecc-4b0d-11e8-9bf6-467638719d40.gif)

## 3.3 **Chair** 

Right clicking this structure will make you sit on it.

The sitting position will be the tallest tile in the center of the structure. For the example used in the next part, see the image below:

![2018-04-28_17 08 40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400842-7b3075fa-4b0e-11e8-8045-cee6dbdeb201.png)

### 3.3.1 Setting up a Simple Chair:

**1-** First we need to build a chair, put it into a recipe and select the Chair type;

![chair setting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400803-96b0018e-4b0d-11e8-916c-6ec10c508d65.gif)

**2-** After that, use the Wrench to create the Chair structure from the recipe;

![chair placing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400808-bf5be77e-4b0d-11e8-9b1a-35609de62ede.gif)

**3-** After you get the Chair in your hand, put it wherever you want and right click it.

![chair using](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400809-c26e47ea-4b0d-11e8-9aa1-c2dae7856d8f.gif)

### 3.3.2 Setting up a Covered Chair

![2018-04-28_17 31 54](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400857-ec6b32be-4b0e-11e8-92ec-e7df832c471f.png)


For chairs that have some sort of cover above the sitting area, a new method needs to be applied. Since the sitting area is set on the tallest tile near the center, depending on the structure of the chair, the sitting position may end up in the wrong place.

![2018-04-28_17 28 32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400843-7cabe9b4-4b0e-11e8-90f7-3c3c6716a83e.png)

This is what happened if you use the method described in 3.3.1:

![chair unconventional wrong](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400871-1c835aee-4b0f-11e8-9b58-89958dc78dcf.gif)

In order to avoid this, use this new method:

**1-** Separate the top area of the chair so you the center is uncovered:

![chair unconventional fix 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400872-1fb0f5fa-4b0f-11e8-8e11-72dc086bb0fb.gif)

**2-** Put the uncovered chair in the Recipe and then follow the process the same way as in 3.3.1. Place it then place the rest of the chair on top of it.

![chair unconventional fix 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400873-20927db8-4b0f-11e8-9163-ad909fba222a.gif)

**NOTE:** Depending on the size or shape of the chair, it may be difficult or impossible to use Third Person view.

## 3.4 **Door** 

Makes a rotating door. The rotation axis can be moved to any area of the structure, in either XYZ axis. With this you can create things like doors, trapdoors, or even other rotating structures. For more information, check the [Doors](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Doors) section of the wiki.

## 3.5 **Sliding Door** 

Creates a door that slides in the direction of the axis. For more information, check the [Doors](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Doors) section of the wiki.

## 3.6 **Ladder** 

Creates a functional ladder. It'll work essentially the same way as a standard vanilla Minecraft ladder.

### 3.6.1. Setting Up

**1-** Build a ladder using LittleTiles and place it in a Recipe.

![ladder setup](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400949-9603461c-4b10-11e8-9f1a-4787c27caecb.gif)

**2-** Using a Wrench, create the Ladder from the recipe and place it wherever you want (unlike vanilla ladders, it's not limited to walls.

![ladder placing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400950-970e6938-4b10-11e8-8058-02d0abe6eae9.gif)

**3-** Climb it!

![ladder using](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39400951-97596988-4b10-11e8-9bd5-f7d4b52334f9.gif)


## 3.7 **Bed** 

Creates a functional bed. The laying position is determined the same way as the chair, while the horizontal orientation must be selected in the recipe GUI.

![gui](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39402698-4326df30-4b3d-11e8-983d-a2b9009a1dbe.png)

**(1)** - Structure Type

**(2)** - Head Position

**(3)** - Preview (top view)

**(4)** - Save settings

### 3.7.1 Direction Setting


Before starting, it's important to note that the position you'll be facing is determined by the settings in the Recipe. The default is East, meaning that when you lay down on the bed, the top of your head will be pointing towards East (your view will be facing the opposite direction, West).

The image below will serve as reference for when the setting up process is explained:

![2018-04-28_17 42 41](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39402692-2559c904-4b3d-11e8-90da-7ef6baa510a6.png)

Ingame you can check the cardinal directions by pressing F3:

![2018-04-28_17 42 30](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39402690-0e8e5f28-4b3d-11e8-8e4a-816c48d73417.png)

### 3.7.2 Setting Up

**1-** First, create a bed, put it in a Recipe and select the Bed structure type;

![bed setting 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39402745-e0daa04e-4b3e-11e8-9316-06217b738655.gif)

**2-** Then, select the facing direction and use the Wrench to put it in the world. In this case we selected East, meaning that when we lay in the bed our head will be pointing towards the Orange side (East), while we'll be facing the Pink side (West);

![bed setting 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39402746-e2cc0708-4b3e-11e8-9d15-60c8e43e36d1.gif)

**3-** For example, setting it as South will make you face the Blue side (North);

![bed setting 3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39402747-e382d776-4b3e-11e8-963c-c290a81a463e.gif)


## 3.8 **Storage** 

Creates a functional storage. The amount of storage slots is designated by the amount of storage tiles in the structures. For more information, check the [Little Storage](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Little-Storage-Block) section of the wiki.

## 3.9 **Noclip** 

Creates a structure you can walk through. 

![2018-04-29_02 14 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39403470-7fb15136-4b53-11e8-9814-db143960a4cd.png)

**(1)** Type of Structure

**(2)** Cobweb Slowness

**(3)** Save settings

### 3.9.1 Setting Up

**1-** First, create a structure, put it in a Recipe and select the Noclip structure type. Untick the Cobweb Slowness box if you don't wish to be slowed when walking through the structure.

![noclip 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29471180/39403471-8cf15ed6-4b53-11e8-8811-5d2535bed5b4.gif)

**2-** Use the Wrench to create the structure from the recipe then put it in your world.

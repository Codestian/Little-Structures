To craft a structure, simply use put a recipe in the first slot and press Craft. If you have the necessary materials, the structure will be outputted in the second slot. The source recipe will not be consumed.

### Combining Structure and Recipe

If you want to put a interactive structure (a door or chair, for example) back into a Little Recipe all you need to do is put the structure in question in the first slot and a Little Recipe in the second and press Craft.

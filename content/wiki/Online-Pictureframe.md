**General**
Online Picture Frame is a simple mod and addon to LittleTiles by CreativeMD that allows you to add custom pictures and gifs into Minecraft, without the need to upload them to the server and no need to download them from the server. Instead, the pictures are taken from an image sharing website (Imgur is recommended)and downloaded from there, and this helps keep the server lag-free. Online Pictureframe blocks are also LT compatible.

The interface is quite simple and includes options to make the frame around the picture visible/invisible, how many blocks away the image should be rendered from, and the x y sizes.

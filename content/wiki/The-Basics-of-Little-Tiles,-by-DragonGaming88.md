# The Basics of Little Tiles

### Getting Started

To get started with Little Tiles, you will need a [Little Bag](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Little-Bag) a [Little Chisel](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Little-Chisel), an [Little Recipie](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Little-Recipe)/[Advanced Recipe](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Advanced-Recipe) and a [Little Workbench](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Little-Workbench).

### Using the Little Bag

To open the GUI, press **C**. This will bring up the interface. To the top left of the interface, you will find a window, where you can put blocks into, for easy conversion to Little Tiles. These are then able to be placed by a chisel.

### Using the Little Chisel

Pressing **C** will bring up the Little Chisel GUI. Using it, you can select a block to use, from either your inventory or the Little Bag. The mode of placement can be changed. For a start, Dragbox is recommended. Also, the colour and transparency of the tiles placed can be changed. Right clicking on the surface, you would like to place the tiles on will allow you to place a tile. In Dragbox mode, you will see a semi-transparent preview when before the tile is placed. Using it, you can edit the dimensions of the tiles you will place. 

### Using the Advanced Recipe

If you have created an object that you are happy with, or would like to assign a function to, the Little Recipe can be used. Right clicking on one corner of the object will select the first point, and right clicking again on the opposite corner of the object will allow you to select the second point. Pressing **C** will bring up the GUI of the recipe. In it, you will find different things you can do with the object you created. For example, you can make the object into a chair, a bed, or even a storage block, if the object has [Storage Tiles](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Little-Storage-Block) in it. The object can also be made into a [Rotating Door](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Doors#11-rotating-door), and a [Sliding Door](https://github.com/CreativeMD/LittleTiles/wiki/Doors#22-sliding-door). The advanced recipie, while a little more expensive in the short term, is slightly easier, as you will not need to craft a little workbench.

### Using the Little Recipe

Left click one corner of the structure you wish to copy. Left click on the other corner to select the other corner of the area in which the structure resides. Pressing **C** will bring up the interface just as before. The same options can be used, but to place the object you copied on the recipie, you will need to use the Little Workbench

### Using the Little Workbench

(If using and advanced recipe, this is not needed.) Placing the Little Recipe you have created into the left GUI slot will allow you to create the item stored on the recipe, if you have all needed material. If you do not have all needed material, the Little Workbench will show which you need.
